Silver Screen Review




📝 Description

Silver Screen Review is a full-stack movie review platform that allows users to explore movies, read and add reviews, and rate films in a clean, user-friendly interface.
Authenticated users can add, edit, and delete their reviews, while admins can manage movies, monitor user reviews, and handle feedback.
The application is built using React and Tailwind CSS for the frontend, Node.js + Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database.
The entire app is containerized using Docker, allowing it to run seamlessly with a single command.
